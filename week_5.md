# Week 5
[Week outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/#week-5)

## Week's Goals
* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language

## Daily Goals
### Monday
1. Review someone else code and get my code reviewed. 
* Achieved by:
  * Reviewed [Rhianne's code](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge/pull/1293#pullrequestreview-264690393)
  * Was able to give feedback on what was done well and what could have been improved.
  * Had [my weekend challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge/pull/1283#discussion_r305734636) reviewed by Rhianne. Took on board that there was some repeated code I could have refactored out becuase of failing the DRY test. Need to be careful to get database set up instructions correct. Also took on board the praise for my detailed README file and for my code generally. 
  * GENERAL OTHER POINT: when using databases need to set up a suitable RAKE file, e.g. https://github.com/samover/chitter/blob/master/Rakefile

2. Understand this weeks goals and set my own additional goals if appropriate.
