## Daily Goals

### Monday
1. Understand goals for the week and establish how I am going to achieve them.
* It was explained to us that the focus on this week is databases. This is going to be a tough week with a look of new things to learn but we are not expected to learn everything. 
* With this in mind I will take it in small steps and try to understand one or two things only per day. 

2. Have code reviewed and review someone elses code. 
* [My weekend pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/pull/1343)
* I reviewed [Kareem's code](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/pull/1345#pullrequestreview-261696717). I was able to read his code easily, give him feedback, praising him on what I though was good code and also make some suggestions of how it could have be improved.

## Takeaways/Notes
### Week kick-off
* Theme of the week is databases
* A lot to learn this week. Can feel overwhelmed. You will not be able to learn everything.
