## Daily Goals

### Monday
1. Understand goals for the week and establish how I am going to achieve them.
* It was explained to us that the focus on this week is databases. This is going to be a tough week with a look of new things to learn but we are not expected to learn everything. 
* With this in mind I will take it in small steps and try to understand one or two things only per day. 

2. Have code reviewed and review someone elses code. 
* [My weekend challenge pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/pull/1343)
  * Received some helpful feedback - like reducing lines of code where possible, and have less actual code in VIEW files. 
* I reviewed [Kareem's weekend challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/pull/1345#pullrequestreview-261696717). I was able to read his code easily, give him feedback, praising him on what I though was good code and also made some suggestions of how it could have be improved.

### Tuesday
(Lo√Øc and I got up to [step 6](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/bookmark_manager/06_manipulating_table_data.md), i.e. completed 5. 

## Takeaways/Notes
### Week kick-off
