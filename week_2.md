## Goals for the Week:
GIVEN BY MAKERS:
1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)

2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking

4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)

5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

PERSONAL
6. Write a blog.

1. Try in pair programming to actually use proper driver-navigator process. Previously, this has been a bit ad hoc. 

2. Ask for feedback on my pair programming. Is there anything I can do better?

3. Learn about code reviewing.


## Takeaways & Reflections from the week
* Re MOCKS and DOUBLES - I THINK that you make a mock for the class that you are currently test and you create a double for a class outside of the one you are testing.
