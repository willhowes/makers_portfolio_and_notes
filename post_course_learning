## TDD and BDD 
Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM&feature=youtu.be)
#### Takeaways:
- We should be testing methods but test a requirement. i.e. what is required of the code
- Sometimes easier to think of it as BDD - drive the code by testing the behaviour of the system
- The behaviour is the requirement - that is what you should be testing not the methods themselves
- Think of you program as a public facing API
- Refactor is the key part of RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- Test behaviours not implementations

Running through the steps:

1. RED - write a test that doesn't work, and perhaps doesn't even compile at first

2. GREEN - make the test work quickly, commiting whatevers sins necessary in the process. 
- Copying and pasting code from stack overflow fine. 
- i.e. write code that satisfies the behaviour as quickly as possible.
- At this stage you are trying to understand the problem.
- Write sinful code!
- Not sure how to get to green - use a REPL
- Can try some other tests but delete these

3. REFACTOR - when we produce clean code
- Look for code smells. Is there a better way of doing this?
- Safe moves that changes the design of your code
- Still remain covered by your original tests
- Do not write new tests at this step
- e.g. if you are making a new class and extracting from old class - do not write new tests! unless you have realised there is a new bit of behaviour that needs testing
- Eliminate the dependancy between your tests and the code

#### Code smells
- Duplicated code 
- Long Method 
- Large Classs
- Long parameter list
- Switch Statements

### Mocking
- Don't use mocks to isolate classes.
