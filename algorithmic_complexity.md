# Algorithmic Complexity 

## Kick off - Tuesday 17 September

### What is an algoritm?
* Set of instructions to solve a problem

### What is algorithmic complexity?
* relates to scaling
* how does the process grow as the input grows?
* e.g. does making 100 omlettes take 100 times as long as 1, or less than a 100 times, more than 100? 

* What is the fastest algorithm?
- Depends on input size
- But can see which is least complex/has best complexity
* Complexity of algorithm, using lines on graph (size of input / time)
- Constant time
- Logarithmic complexity
- Linear complexity
- Quadratic complexity
- Exponential complexity

### Homework
* Come up with a timing framework for your code:
- try with the languages built in methods:
-- .reserve method
-- .last method (i.e. last item in array)
-- .sort
- stick with same language
- work out the algorithmic complexity based on time for the above (i.e. test time for small, mid and large inputs)

## Algorithmic Efficiency Video Notes

* Steps the aglorithm take is approximately equal to the execution time
* Algorithm's efficiency = step growth as the the input grows (i.e. how many more steps needs as the input gets bigger)

* Focus on how the algorithm handles very large nnumbers
* Things to look into:
-- Asymptotic notation
