# WEEK 1 GOALS

[Week 1 Outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/ "WEEK 1")

## Daily Goals
### Wednesday
1. Go through Boris Bikes steps again to understand some of the concepts better - 1hr
  - Achieved by looking the extra resources. e.g. looked at youu
 tube videos for feature test and stack trace to better understand these.
2. Improve on debugging (slow it down, take it step  by step) - 1hr

## Goals for the Week:

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

3. Follow an effective debugging process

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## How did I achieve my goals?

### 1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods

### 2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Effective pairing using driver-navigator style on the Week 1 [Boris Bikes exercise](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/dearshrewdwit/projects/1418)
- Gave and received feedback to pair programming partners after each session.

### 3. Follow an effective debugging process
- Used the following method for debugging in the [FizzBuzz debugging exercise] (https://github.com/willhowes/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/debugging_fizzbuzz):
  - Tighten the loop by reading the error code to find out on what line the code fails.
  - Get visibility using "p" to print to the screen variables and statements to check what the line of code is doing
  - Once the issue is discovered, amend the code so the test passes.

### 4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
