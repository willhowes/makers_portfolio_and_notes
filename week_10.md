[Week outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/individual_challenges)

## Week's Goals

* Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code?
By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.

### Have I achieved the above goals?

* Yes, in my team throughout the week, we used high-quality process to build our ['Acebook' project](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/acebook---CharliesAngels).

## Own Goals for the Week

1. Have a my process reviewed
a) With an official process review
b) By recording my screen and sending to a coach

2. Complete 2 tech tests
- Start by trying to solve the problem
- Then look at the form
- Then approve the code and repeat until you happy with the code quality. 


## Takeaways & Notes

### Week kick off
* The Feedback loop:

Receive F'back => reflect/plan => improvement

* Why is process important?
- helps to solve any problem
- employers will look at it
- a repeatable toolset
- gives you an approach to solving a problem

* Processes we have learned at Makers:
- TDD
- Debugging
- Self-led learning
- Pairing
- Working in teams (agile, communication)
- Refacting
- Modelling (inc. Domain Modelling)
- Organising work (inc. Version Control)
- Problem solving (which itself uses some of the above processes)

* Code Quality
- DRY
- SRP
- Readable
- Maintainable
- Has high test coverage
- Decoupling (for which you could use, for example, Dependancy injection for) 

N.B. Quality (in engineering terms) means solving user needs

- Why do you write code?
1. To solve user needs - does it work?
2. For your team/other developers - is it readable, understandable, maintainable?

* Naming conventions
- descriptive
- variable names should describe what data it holds. This should come from the domain (i.e. what we are trying to work with, the topic).

* Comments 
- Should not say HOW the code works.
- Instead of using comments, properly named variables, methods etc should do this for you. 
- However, a comment to say WHY the code was done a certain way is a valid comment (e.g. to explain that is sends error message due to an issue with an API) 

* Testing your code quality:
- Get someone else to read it. Maybe someone with less experience (in the junior cohort, maybe?).
- Is the code easy to change?
- Can I easily add a feature? If I have to add a feature, how much of the code do I need to change?
