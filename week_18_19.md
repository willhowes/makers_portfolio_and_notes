# Notes from Weeks 18 and 19

## Java

### Functions
#### Make up 
```
public returnType nameOfFunction(params) {

}
```

* every Java programme must have at least one function. 

### Classes

* every program must also have a class which contains at least one method (a function belonging to a class)

* example: 
```
public class Main {
  public void main() {
  
  }
}
```
### Package
* A package groups related classes



## CS50

### Lecture 0
* Computer Science and programming. You are given an input and what to give back an output and the problem solving is how you handle the input to produce the desired output. 

* To represent numbers we have a 1s place a 10s place, a 100s place, etc. i.e. 123 can be represented as 1 x 100, 2 x 10 and 3 x 1. So we count in powers of 10. 

* Becuase computers can only understand on or off they calculate using powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. (as opposed to 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc). 

Binary number examples: 

* Binary 000 represents 0 because 0 x 4, 0 x 2 and 0 x 1 
* Binary 010 represents 2 because 0 x 4, 1 x 2 and 0 x 1
* Binary 011 represents 3 because 0 x 4, 1 x 2 and 1 x 1

Another way to represent the above examples using three switches or bits would be:

* off, off, off represents 0
* off, off, on represents 1
* off, on, off represents 2
* on, on, on represents 7

* a 'bit' means a binary digit
* A bite is 8 bits

* How would be represents letters and other information:
-- they are represented by a number. But how does the computer know whether it is a number or a letter - you tell the computer what the context of interpreting those numbers. 

* Standard code is ASCII http://www.asciitable.com/
Capital A is represented by 65
66 = B
67 = C
etc
97 = a
98 = b
etc

* HI! represents as ASCII is 72,73,33
* The binary of the ASCII codes is 1001000 (1x64 + 1x8), 1001001 (1x64, 1x8, 1x1), 100001(1x32, 1x1)

#### Absraction
* is the idea of taking a very low-level implementation details (e.g. binary) and simplifying these to a higher level (e.g. decimal numbers or letters or ASCII) to solve the problem and we do not have to worry about binary. 

- 

* ASCII is limited to 8 bits (256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2) so the max number of characters we can represent as number is 256 

* Unicode or UTF-8 is now used which limited to 32 bits so can store 2 to the power of 32 values (4,294,967,295) and so hence why you can now use UTF-8 to represent tons and tons of emojis as well as numbers, letters, characters. 

#### Color representation 
* to represent pixels on a screen we use 3 bites (8-bit each) RGB (how much red, how much green, how much blue) with ranges of 255 each (because each one is a bite or 8-bit). 

#### Video on a phone or computer screen abstracted
- A video is just a collection of images
- An image is just a collection of colours (in pixels)
- Colours are just patterns of RGB in bits
- Bits are just the result of electricity coming into the machine
