# Notes from Weeks 18 and 19

## CS50

### Lecture 0
* Computer Science and programming. You are given an input and what to give back an output and the problem solving is how you handle the input to produce the desired output. 

* To represent numbers we have a 1s place a 10s place, a 100s place, etc. i.e. 123 can be represented as 1 x 100, 2 x 10 and 3 x 1. So we count in powers of 10. 

* Becuase computers can only understand on or off they calculate using powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. (as opposed to 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc). 

Binary number examples: 

* Binary 000 represents 0 because 0 x 4, 0 x 2 and 0 x 1 
* Binary 010 represents 2 because 0 x 4, 1 x 2 and 0 x 1
* Binary 011 represents 3 because 0 x 4, 1 x 2 and 1 x 1

* a 'bit' means a binary digit
