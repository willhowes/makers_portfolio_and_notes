## Week's Goals

* Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?


### Have I achieved the above goals?

## Own Goals for the Week

1. Have a my process reviewed

2. Get an understanding of rails

3. Have a look at Big O Notation. 

## Takeaways & Notes

### Week kick off
* What doesn high-quality processes mean:
- Standups/Retros
- TDD
- XP Values
- Agile
- Planning
- Git workflow
- Pairing

* N.B. Standups are not the same as planning.
- Standups: what you did yesterday? what your goals for the day? Mood check-ins.

* These two weeks are all about the process.

* Rota for planning session?

* Use Trello for managing workflow.

### General Notes on Rails
* Very good Ruby on Rails book: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/
* It uses the MVC patter.

* The Controller part is referred to as the 'ActiveController'
* The Model part is referred to at the 'ActiveRecord'
* The View is referred to as the 'ActionView'
* ```config``` configures the routes to send you to the correct controller.

* in erb files use ```<%= some_ruby_code %>``` if we are outputting something or ```<% some_ruby_code %>``` if no output is being rendered. Use ```<%# some_ruby_comment %>``` for commenting.

* Example of how to create a one to many relationship (comments on a blog post):
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#adding-a-second-model

* In terms of having a class in Rails, when you set up the model, the class's attributes are determined by the rows that are in that class's databases. For example, if you have set up a ```User``` model 

* sign-up, etc in Rails: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up

* Rails has ```has_many``` and ```belongs_to``` methods for setting up databases to have many-to-one or many-to-many relationsips. 

### Careers workshop
* Process about persuading an employer to give you an interview more important than your CV.
- LinkedIn, twitter, events, etc. Find a company you want to work for...
- Still have to have a CV though...
* If there's a company you really want to work for then let careers team know.
